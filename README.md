# Decentralized_Voting_System_Simulator
The Decentralized Voting System Simulator is a Java application that models a secure voting process using blockchain concepts like cryptographic hashing and immutability. It simulates voter registration, casting votes, and tallying results by linking vote records as blocks in a chain, making them tamper-proof and permanent. The system prevents double voting by verifying voter registration and tracks votes securely on a chain that can be audited for transparency and integrity. This lightweight Java-based blockchain emulation provides a trustworthy way to manage elections and protect vote data from manipulation or deletion.
