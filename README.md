# Decentralized_Voting_System_Simulator
The Decentralized Voting System Simulator is a Java application that emulates a secure and transparent voting process using blockchain principles such as cryptographic hashing and immutability.
The system models voter registration, vote casting, and result tallying by linking votes as blocks in a chained structure, ensuring that once a vote is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted without detection. This immutable ledger provides a tamper-proof history that enhances trust and integrity in the election process.

The application prevents double voting by validating voter identities and maintains voter anonymity while allowing full auditability of the results. By simulating blockchain behavior with cryptographic techniques, the system provides a lightweight, accessible framework for election management that reduces risks associated with traditional voting methods such as tampering, data breaches, and lack of transparency. The project showcases how fundamental blockchain concepts can be applied to build trustworthy, decentralized election systems without relying on complex external platforms or contracts.

Overall, it offers a proof-of-concept solution to improve democratic participation by making elections more secure, transparent, and verifiable through innovative use of Java and blockchain technology.
